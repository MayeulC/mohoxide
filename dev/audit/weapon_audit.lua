-- dev/audit/weapon_audit.lua: one real engagement per weapon blueprint.
-- Enumerates every weapon-bearing unit blueprint (sorted, like
-- all_units.lua); for each blueprint weapon builds a case
-- (attacker bp, weapon index, target, geometry, budget; every budget, deadline
-- and settle is in game ticks, measured with GetGameTick, never by counting
-- WaitTicks yields: a WaitTicks(n) wakes n - 1 ticks later): the attacker
-- (ARMY_1) at one end of a reserved cell, the target (ARMY_2, hold fire,
-- immortal) at max(MinRadius+2, MaxRadius*0.9) along the row.
-- The census (src/weapon_audit.rs: --audit-table, --audit-test,
-- tests/weapon_audit.rs) runs EVERY CASE IN A SESSION OF ITS OWN
-- (WEAPON_AUDIT_CASE = id) on /maps/audit_duel, after one plan session
-- (WEAPON_AUDIT_PLAN) that resolves the statically known cases (non-attack
-- and unsupported) and lists the rest: cases sharing a session observed each
-- other (neighbours acquired, blocked and hit each other's units; the
-- per-tick path budget and entity-id staggering coupled them; and a case's
-- absolute position changes its result), so a row is only the case's own
-- when nothing else runs. A single case's strip is the one nearest the map
-- centre that fits its media (row 0 through the centre, then rows north).
-- The target kind: dev/audit/scenario.lua lists the kinds the weapon's
-- TargetRestrictOnlyAllow / Disallow allow, in preference order (building,
-- land tank, surface ship, sub, fighter; the fighter first for AA weapons),
-- and the weapon's LIVE caps a few ticks after spawning the attackers pick
-- the first on a layer it can fire at (Land -> building / tank, Water ->
-- frigate, Water/Sub/Seabed -> FA's T1 sub spawned surfaced, Air ->
-- fighter). An explicit override target applies only when the restrictions
-- allow it and it does not fight those caps, or when the caps are empty —
-- the class the overrides exist for. Empty caps -> UNSUPPORTED (no-caps),
-- caps with no allowed kind -> UNSUPPORTED (restrict).
-- Anti-projectile weapons (TargetType RULEWTT_Projectile): a tactical
-- anti-missile (scenario intercept) has a SOURCE at the far end instead of
-- a target: the faction T2 tactical launcher (catalog tml, ARMY_2,
-- immortal) 150 away, given one missile, IssueTactical at the attacker's
-- position; a strategic one (the SMDs, given one interceptor as tactical
-- silo ammo) the faction nuke launcher (catalog nuke) 450 away, IssueNuke;
-- an anti-torpedo one the faction T1 torpedo launcher (catalog torpedo,
-- floating, at the surface) 40 away, IssueAttack on the attacker. The attacker is immortal, gets no order and its fire state goes
-- normal with the others'; the unit's other anti-projectile weapons are
-- switched off (SetWeaponEnabledByLabel) so they can't race it for the
-- missile. The damage column counts the source's missiles STOPPED: damaged
-- by the case's weapon (credit as below), named by the source's
-- OnMissileIntercepted (defense = the attacker, after this weapon fired), or
-- redirected (IsRedirected: flares, the Loyalist's deflector; or retargeted
-- with SetNewTarget onto one of the case's projectiles: FAF's DepthCharge,
-- the Smart Charges and Cybran anti-torpedo flares) without
-- damaging the attacker; the stage text names the rule and the damage
-- missiles did to the attacker.
-- The attacker's layer (scenario.attacker_layer): a key of the weapon's
-- FireTargetLayerCapsTable the unit can occupy, the natural spawn layer
-- first; the spawn medium follows it (floating units at the surface). A
-- SurfacingSub firing from the other depth gets IssueDive, and its attack
-- order once there (DIVE_WAIT). After the spawn settle an attacker off its
-- planned layer is UNSUPPORTED (layer); an attacker that replaced itself
-- (HARMS xrb2308 -> xrb2309) hands its case to the new unit on its spot.
-- Economy and enhancements: ARMY_1 has 10M energy stored before anything
-- spawns; an EnabledByEnhancement weapon's enhancement is made after its
-- unit spawns (Prerequisite chain root first, presets keep theirs); the
-- OverCharge weapon fires through IssueOverCharge at the target, the
-- AutoOverCharge weapon through SetAutoOvercharge(true) and the attack.
-- Silo launchers (CountedProjectile + ManualFire, not anti-projectile):
-- one missile given (GiveNukeSiloAmmo / GiveTacticalSiloAmmo by
-- NukeWeapon), IssueNuke / IssueTactical at the target's position, the
-- target at 0.9 MaxRadius capped at D_SILO, budget from the missile's speed.
-- Long range (MaxRadius > 600): the target at 0.9 MaxRadius, clamped to
-- D_SILO (the 4000-range guns: the map holds no more; the case line says
-- 'map clamp' with the window 0.75..0.9 MaxRadius it could not reach);
-- the budget adds the high-arc flight, the turret's pitch slew, ten reloads
-- and the unpack (WeaponUnpacks), and is not held to the 1800 cap.
-- A case that never damaged its target names its nearest impact.
-- Threads forked while a case's damage code runs (nuke rings, DoT) are the
-- case's: their later damage credits it.
-- Weapons that are not attacks (death, teleport, guidance, dummy weapons;
-- see non_attack_of) never engage: outcome NON-ATTACK, so UNSUPPORTED only
-- lists real weapons the audit can't set up yet.
-- Attackers hold fire from spawn (no auto-acquisition before their order);
-- once the targets exist every case gets its one IssueAttack (units table,
-- target as entity) and all attackers go fires-on the same tick. Stage
-- trail (behaviour-neutral, only counters wrapped around real calls):
--   fired  = CreateProjectileAtMuzzle count on the case's weapon instance
--            (beam weapons start their beam there), plus any
--            CreateProjectileForWeapon call made outside it (FAF's
--            CreateProjectileAtMuzzle chains it: counted once per shot);
--   held   = the weapon holds a target (WeaponHasTarget/GetCurrentTarget)
--            and whether it is the case's target;
--   credit = per weapon instance, never per unit: the case's projectiles
--            (and their fragments / child projectiles) have OnImpact
--            wrapped, its beams' CollisionBeam OnImpact too, and the
--            target's OnDamage counts damage only while one of those runs
--            for this case (Damage/DamageArea call OnDamage synchronously).
--            The unit's other weapons pass nothing on (FAF names the
--            launcher unit as every weapon's instigator); TreeForce /
--            TreeFire (ignored by Unit.OnDamage) never count; damage from
--            the attacker outside them shows as 'uncredited unit dmg'.
-- Outcome per case: pass (credit > 0 within its budget) | no-target (never
-- acquired) | held-no-fire (acquired a target, never fired) | fired-no-hit
-- (fired, nothing landed) | hit-no-damage (impacted, 0 credited) |
-- non-attack | unsupported | map-nosupport. Never-engaged rows carry a
-- reason token (reasonKey: death/teleport/guidance/dummy/not-attack for
-- non-attack; silo/anti-proj:torp/anti-proj:missile/restrict/
-- no-caps/layer/spawn/no-cell for the others) that the table prints and
-- tallies in its legend. One
--   AUDIT <key> <attacker>[<weapon>] vs <target>: <outcome> (fired n, dmg n <stage>)
-- line per case, and machine rows in case order:
--   _G.AUDIT_RESULTS[i] = 'key|attacker|weaponIdx|target|outcome|fired|damage'
--   _G.AUDIT_CASES[i]   = { id=, key=, bearing=, aim=, attacker=, weapon=,
--       target=, x=, z=, budget=, attName=, weaponName=, tgtName=, reason=,
--       reasonKey= }
-- Case ids are 1..N from the (sorted) blueprint walk and STABLE across runs.
-- Bearings (1b below): a Turreted weapon on a ground / naval unit or
-- structure (not silo, intercept, overcharge or long-range cases) also runs
-- with its target at other bearings off the attacker's facing: sub-cases
-- keyed 'id@bearing' (degrees; positive = the side positive
-- HeadingArcCenter points, the unit's right), each its own session, rows
-- right after the canonical row (the plain id, target straight ahead, which
-- stays as it was) in clockwise order. The attacker faces +z, the target
-- stands at the case's distance on the bearing, the line's midpoint as near
-- the map centre as the media allow. WEAPON_AUDIT_BEARINGS = 'gate'
-- (default, the golden's: 180 plus the bearing nearest a limited arc's
-- centre), 'all' (every 45 degrees), 'none' or a list ('90,135'); a
-- structure only takes bearings inside its arc. Each case's AUDIT line ends
-- with its aim evidence (aim_of: bearing, body turn, arc, the turret's yaw
-- offset at the first shot, mean miss across / along the line);
-- dev/audit/bearing_report.py tabulates it. WEAPON_AUDIT_TRACE = true logs
-- AUDITTRACE lines (turn, aim heading / pitch, target position) every 20
-- ticks per open case.
-- Globals set before the run select cases: WEAPON_AUDIT_CASE = n or 'n@b'
-- (the case stands alone, its engagement midpoint at the map centre: the
-- census's session for that case; any bearing b of a weapon that takes
-- bearings) or WEAPON_AUDIT_IDS = 'a,b,c' (same ids as the full run, a bare
-- id with its listed bearings, 'n@b' one bearing; all in ONE session in the
-- scan layout, where bearing sub-cases are map-nosupport: x-strips on rows, probed like
-- all_units.lua's place — for watching several engagements at once on the
-- 81 km /maps/audit_flat; those cases can interfere, so their rows are not
-- the census's); no globals = all of them in one session that way.
-- WEAPON_AUDIT_PLAN = true (with or without WEAPON_AUDIT_IDS) is the
-- census's plan pass: the statically known cases (non-attack, unsupported)
-- resolve (rows as usual), every other id goes to _G.AUDIT_PENDING
-- ({ id =, key =, budget = }) and nothing spawns. A selection matching nothing
-- fails the run naming the case count.
