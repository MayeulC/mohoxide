-- Scenario test (tests/scenarios.rs): an army's blip of a unit is one object
-- of FAF's Blip class (moho's ReconBlip makes its Lua object from
-- /lua/sim/Blip.lua): GetBlip returns it each time, fields set on it stay,
-- and OnIntelChange passes the same one. Moho keeps a blip until its unit
-- dies in its army's intel, then destroys it (OnDestroy runs the destroy
-- hooks); a tank dying out of sight keeps its blip, a structure dying out of
-- sight is "maybe dead" until the army sees the spot (FAF probe probe_blip).
-- The engine's
-- cache holds a blip weakly until a script stores a field on it: one a
-- script keeps, or wrote to, survives a collection (sim::gc collects every
-- 100 ticks), one nothing keeps or touched is collected.
