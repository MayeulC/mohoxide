-- Scenario test (tests/scenarios.rs): when an engineer's guard (assist)
-- ends. As moho's guard task (MohoEngine.dll 0x101fe9b0 / 0x101fcfa0):
-- an engineer with nothing to help with lets go of its guard when another
-- order is queued behind it, so a shift-queued build takes over once the
-- assisted engineer's build is done (not before: it keeps helping while
-- there is work); a guard started on a unit under construction ends once
-- that unit is finished and idle. Non-engineers keep guarding, as does an
-- engineer with nothing queued behind.
